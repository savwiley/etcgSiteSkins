# etcgSiteSkins
CSS site skins that work with [Bloo's eTCG](https://github.com/filler00/etcg).

## How to Install

1. Download the css sheet of the one you like best. You can even just copy/paste it if you want.
2. Upload it to your site:
  2A. You can either name your new stylesheet "style.css" and upload it to your site's "eTCG" folder to overwrite the original.
  2B. OR you can go into your site's "eTCG" folder, download your `header.php`, search for `Custom styles for this template` near the top, and change the url to the name of your new stylesheet. There are more steps involved, but you can upload as many css files as you want like this without overwriting old ones.
